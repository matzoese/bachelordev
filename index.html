        <h1>Example Traced Tutor for Python Programming</h1>
        <p>
            This tutor aims at teaching python programming and testing your skills by providing you with python tasks of different topics and levels of difficulty.
            You are asked to solve 4 tasks, which will be selected randomly for you. Try your best and if you need help use the hint button on the bottom of the task.  
            Using the hint button will also be taken into consideration for your "final score", so try to use it only when you can't continue otherwise.
            You will have to solve one task before being able to continue on to the next.
            Think before writing or selecting your answers, since each mistake will be counted. 
            When you are done with a task, click on the done button to continue on to the next task.
        <p>
            The rest of it should be self-explanatory, so have fun and good luck!
