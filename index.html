        <h1>Example Traced Tutor for Python Programming</h1>
        <p>
            This tutor provides you with python tasks of different topics and levels of difficulty.
            You are asked to solve 4 tasks, which will be selected randomly for you.  
            You will have to solve one task before being able to continue on to the next.
            Think before writing or selecting your answers, since each mistake will be counted. 
        </p>
        <p>
            You will be provided with a hint button in every task, which you can use to get hints to each section of the task you are currently solving.
            This will also be taken into consideration for your "final score", so try to use the hint button only when you can't continue otherwise.
            When you are done with a task, click on the done button to continue on to the next task.
        </p>
        <p>
            The rest of it should be self-explanatory, so have fun and good luck!
